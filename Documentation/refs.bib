	title = {The Effects of Memory Replay in Reinforcement Learning},
	abstract = {Experience replay is a key technique behind many recent advances in deep reinforcement learning. Allowing the agent to learn from earlier memories can speed up learning and break undesirable temporal correlations. Despite its widespread application, very little is understood about the properties of experience replay. How does the amount of memory kept affect learning dynamics? Does it help to prioritize certain experiences? In this paper, we address these questions by formulating a dynamical systems {ODE} model of Q-learning with experience replay. We derive analytic solutions of the {ODE} for a simple setting. We show that even in this very simple setting, the amount of memory kept can substantially affect the agent’s performance—too much or too little memory both slow down learning. Moreover, we characterize regimes where prioritized replay harms the agent’s learning. We show that our analytic solutions have excellent agreement with experiments. Finally, we propose a simple algorithm for adaptively changing the memory buffer size which achieves consistently good empirical performance.},

	abstract = {Doodling is a useful and common intelligent skill that people can learn and master. In this work, we propose a two-stage learning framework to teach a machine to doodle in a simulated painting environment via Stroke Demonstration and deep Q-learning ({SDQ}). The developed system, Doodle-{SDQ}, generates a sequence of pen actions to reproduce a reference drawing and mimics the behavior of human painters. In the first stage, it learns to draw simple strokes by imitating in supervised fashion from a set of strokeaction pairs collected from artist paintings. In the second stage, it is challenged to draw real and more complex doodles without ground truth actions; thus, it is trained with Qlearning. Our experiments confirm that (1) doodling can be learned without direct stepby- step action supervision and (2) pretraining with stroke demonstration via supervised learning is important to improve performance. We further show that Doodle-{SDQ} is effective at producing plausible drawings in different media types, including sketch and watercolor.},

	abstract = {Evolution has a key role to play as we push towards Artificial General Intelligence ({AGI}), mainly for three reasons. Firstly the neural evolution and the evolutionary algorithms communities have developed a lot of important ideas that have a role to play in general {AI} research whether or not they ultimately are used on an evolutionary backbone or they're hybridized with other ideas. Secondly evolutionary algorithms themselves may be a key technology for evolution in terms of having a part to play in the overall solution to {AI}. Third, to some extent these names for different fields are metaphorical and so if one thinks about evolution a little bit more broadly as the outer loop learning algorithm which is to say that we have something that kind of moves and learns across generations and then something that learns within a lifetime that outer loop which in nature is evolution and in machine learning sometimes is specifically an evolutionary algorithm or sometimes could be, say reinforcement learning algorithm that outer loop that is definitely going to be critical as we push towards {AGI} and some will call evolution, and some will fail to call it evolution. But at its heart, we're taking inspiration from natural evolution and evolutionary algorithms to do that outer loop activity, and that's essential. So in many different ways, evolutionary algorithms are going to be essential to our push towards {AI}, and we will increasingly see that the machine learning community is starting to take note and play with a lot of the ideas from evolution under its various interpretations and definitions.

Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.
